##Project Concept
```md
Keep House is an task manager app (similar to Trello) aimed at helping housemates
(whether communal, family, dorms, etc.) keep track of what tasks need to be done
around the house.
This idea is step one in a more fully feature fleshed out app I intend to work on
after WDI_020 has finished. I first came up with the idea for this app while
trying to find an app my housemates and I could use to make our lives easier,
through relieving the mental load of keeping track of things which needed doing
around the house. The app will relieve this load through keeping track of tasks
while aggregating the information to the user account or "House", enabling the
ability to mark tasks as completed, or in need of attention.

My initial wire frame, concept sketches, and ERD can be found ```html <a href=https://imgur.com/gallery/dyFTN>here</a>
