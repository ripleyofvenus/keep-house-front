##Project Concept
```md
Keep House is an task manager app (similar to Trello) aimed at helping housemates
(whether communal, family, dorms, etc.) keep track of what tasks need to be done
around the house.
This idea is step one in a more fully feature fleshed out app I intend to work on
after WDI_020 has finished. I first came up with the idea for this app while
trying to find an app my housemates and I could use to make our lives easier,
through relieving the mental load of keeping track of things which needed doing
around the house. The app will relieve this load through keeping track of tasks
while aggregating the information to the user account or "House", enabling the
ability to mark tasks as completed, or in need of attention.

-check off tasks when they are completed
-uncheck tasks when they need to be done again
-change my profile password if needed
```

##If I had more time
```md
-Styling and User experience I wanted to spend more time on. Coming down with a
cold the last two days of the project definitely had different plans, but I'm
happy I was still able to complete my required objectives despite the plague.
```
##Future Additions
```md
-check or strikethrough to mark a task done
-the Username feature will be implemented so that multiple email addresses (users)
can belong to one username (house) and assign each other tasks
-color coding functionality
-ability for a House to have multiple lists
-ability for User to have private lists
-due dates for tasks & auto renew of tasks after a specified amount of time
```
